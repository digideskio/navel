** Hello World **

__Dojo__ is a very slight fork of the excellent [tornado](http://tornadoweb.org) which I use to teach people how to work with python, javascript, HTML and CSS.

I think it's the most direct route to go from total noob to developing professionally.

I try to show the entire stack by going over four lessons covering the basics of modern development: [HTML](http://dojo.pearachute.com/html), [Version Control](http://dojo.pearachute.com/ssh),  [Serverside Scripting](http://dojo.pearachute.com/python), and [Persisting Data](http://dojo.pearachute.com/forms).
