** Hello World **

__Dojo__ is my earnest attempt to describe my technique for building websites, and a program to get *you* to build that website you keep talking about.

It's complex and difficult, but ultimately simpler and more direct than other approaches.  

I start with four lessons covering the basics of modern development: [HTML](http://dojo.pearachute.com/html), [Version Control](http://dojo.pearachute.com/ssh),  [Serverside Scripting](http://dojo.pearachute.com/python), and [Persisting Data](http://dojo.pearachute.com/forms).

Then, I teach how to look up the details they need to finish the real website they've started.
