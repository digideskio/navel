Logging in is called "authentication".

When you type in your login and password, you're telling the webserver who you are, and how you can prove it.

The webserver looks up that information in the database, and (if the passwords match!) it usually creates a *session* with the webbrowser, using cookies.  You don't really need to understand the details if you can set that system up correctly.

The most important thing to check on is how your webserver stores passwords.  The webserver should never store passwords without encryption!  And encryption is almost always wrong!  Usually passwords should be *hashed*.

When data is encrypted, it can only be read with a password.  When it's hashed, it can only be read with brute force attacks.  You don't really need to understand the difference, if you check that your passwords are hashed.

You can tell a system has failed to hash their passwords if they can ever mail you exactly what your password is.  That's why the correct approach is sending you a unique link to *reset* your password.  Mailing a user their personal password is pretty ghetto.
