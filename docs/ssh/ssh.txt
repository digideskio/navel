SSH
===

SSH is a secure way to connect computers on the internet or any other network.  

It usually involves a `user` logging into a `host`.  For example, when I log into the machine that hosts this website, I type `ssh dojo.pearachute.com` in a terminal and see something like this:

--------------------------------------------

`japherwocky@japhercules:/opt/dojo$` **`ssh dojo.pearachute.com`**

	Linux m4ria 2.6.18.8-linode22 #1 SMP Tue Nov 10 16:12:12 UTC 2009 i686

	japherwocky@dojo:~$

(I am the `user` *japherwocky* logging into the `host` *dojo.pearachute.com*.  My computer at home is named *japhercules* and the computer I'm connecting to is named *dojo*.) 

--------------------------------------------

If you're using a Mac or a Linux machine, try doing this in a terminal.  If you're on Windows, you'll have to install some tools first.

One of the best (and conveniently free) SSH programs for Windows is called [PuTTy](/ssh/puttyinstall).

You'll need to use SSH for two things at first:

1. logging into dojo.pearachute.com and [changing your password](/ssh/passwd)
2. moving your code around with [mercurial](/hg)
