** Hello World **

__Dojo__ is my earnest attempt to describe my technique for building websites, and a program to get *you* to build that website you keep talking about.

It's complex and difficult, but simpler than other approaches you might take.  

You'll start with four lessons covering the basic tools:

1. [HTML](/html)
2. [Version Control](/ssh) 
3. [Scripting](/python)
4. [Persisting Data](/forms)

Then, you'll work with a group on building the website *you* want to build.

To get started, get your address on the [mailing list](http://simplemailer.pearachute.com/classes)!
